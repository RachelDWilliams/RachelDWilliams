- 👋 Hi, I’m @RachelDWilliams
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Design, Animals, and table-top gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, Javascript, Java, Web Design, App Design.
- 💞️ I am a self-starter, teaching myself app and web design.  I have a long 
        way to go yet, but I have come a long way and I am proud of it. Please
        check out my various projects, most of which are currently unifinished 
        as I try to balance my work with my studies and personal projects.
